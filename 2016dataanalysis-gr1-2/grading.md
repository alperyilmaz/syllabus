# Course Materials

There's a companion textbook written by the instructor and its PDF version will be provided during the course. The instructor will go through the topics, examples and questions from the book. You are expected to listen to course and take notes during lectures. Also, you are strongly encouraged to study the examples and questions on your own. For programming lectures, reading and studying the material is not enough, the only way to learn and grasp the concepts is **TO PRACTICE IN TERMINAL**. Please go over the examples in book and you're more than welcome to search online for more examples or exercises.

Important announcements and necessary lecture materials will be provided at [YARBIS page](http://yarbis.yildiz.edu.tr/alyilmaz/course/viewCourse/id/7095) of this lecture.

# Grading

Your grade will come from the following sources:

* Midterm: 35%
* Final: 40%
* Quiz: 10%
* Code Academy: 5%
* Course Material Improvement: 5%
* Attendance: 5%
* Bonus: Visualization challenge (5 points)

*Midterm* and *final* are performed in computer lab and students are asked to figure out correct commands in terminal to achieve desired output.

Although the instructor had best intentions to help the students, last year the students abused these best intentions and attempted mass cheating. Thus, the format, number and style of *quizzes* is not determined yet. It will be determined and announced when number of students is finalized. 

As mentioned above, best way to learn terminal is to practice. There's a website where students can follow guided practices. Thus, students are expected to sign up at [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com) website and complete [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line) and [Learn SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sql) courses online. You need to provide your username to instructor so that he can form an online classroom to track your progress. There are paid lessons, projects and quizzes in this website but we'll be going thru only **FREE** lessons.

*Course material improvement* will be accomplished via [Github](https://github.com/). The students are expected to sign up for an account and then edit course book in a collaborative manner. Improvements such as spelling error corrections are welcome but it will get you low scores. Higher scores can be obtained if you can add explanations, samples, questions that can help others understand the topic better.

As for *attendance*, if you attend all lectures or miss only one lecture then you'll get 5 points for attendance. For every 1-2 lectures missed you'll lose 1 point.

*Visualization challenge* is optional and it requires submission of a drawing which will summarize a command or chain of commands **visually**.

# Communication

I'm trying to respond emails as quickly as possible. If you don't get a response within 1-2 days please don't hesitate to send a reminder email.

The changes pertaining to exam date, time and assignment due dates should be decided in class after discussing with everybody. Please don't ask for changes individually, otherwise notification of whole class becomes a hassle.
