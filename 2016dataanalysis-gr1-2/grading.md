# Course Materials

There's a companion textbook written by the instructor and its PDF version will be provided during the course. The instructor will go through the topics, examples and questions from the book. You are expected to listen to course and take notes during lectures. Also, you are strongly encouraged to study the examples and questions on your own. For programming lectures, reading and studying the material is not enough, the only way to learn and grasp the concepts **YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE IN TERMINAL**

Important announcements and necessary lecture materials will be provided at [YARBIS page](http://yarbis.yildiz.edu.tr/alyilmaz/course/viewCourse/id/7095) of this lecture. 

# Grading

Your grade will come from the following sources:

* Midterm: 35%
* Final: 40%
* Quiz: 10%
* Debate: 10%
* Attendance: 5%

There will be 3 quizes and highest 2 scores will be considered. If you attend all lectures or miss only one lecture then you'll get 5 points for attendance. For every 1-2 lectures missed you'll lose 1 point.

For the debate, each student will pick a side (for or against GMO) and defend his/her position individually with **scientific articles**. Also, a short report of the findings should be handed in to instructor.

# Communication

I'm trying to respond emails as quickly as possible. If you don't get a response within 1-2 days please don't hesitate to send a reminder email.

The changes pertaining to exam date, time and assignment due dates should be decided in class after discussing with everybody. Please don't ask for changes individually, otherwise notification of whole class becomes a hassle.
