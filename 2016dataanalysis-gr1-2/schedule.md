# Schedule

Below is the tentative schedule for the course. Depending on the speed we go through topics there might be shifts in the schedule. ***Some weeks you might be asked to study following week's lecture so that we can go through it faster in class***. For each week, first date is for Group 1 (Wednesdays) and second date is for Group 2 (Fridays).

### *September 21/23*. Introduction

The instructor will demonstrate the power of Linux command line and point out fundamental differences between Linux OS and Windows OS. Bear with the instructor if he complains about Windows a lot ;)

### *September 28/30*. Thinks to consider and commands to navigate and manipulate file system

You'll learn about important concepts that will prevent you from being stuck while learning basics of command line. Also, you'll learn commands to navigate (change directories) and manipulate (create, copy, move and delete file/folders) the file system.

Assignment for next week: Let's familirize ourselves with GitHub platform. Please make *useful* edits via GitHub for the book chapter 1 - Linux Operating System due **NEXT WEEK**

### *October 5/7*. Viewing files

Let's see what are the contents of a file. Very large file? No, problem. We can view top or bottom rows of a file instantly no matter how big it is. Viewing small portion of a file quickly will help us having an idea about its content.

*Assignment:* Code Academy - Learn Command Line - Unit 1 is **DUE** this week

*Assignment:* GitHub pull requests for Chapter 1 are **DUE** this week

### *October 12/14*. Generating, modifying, sorting and counting content

Generating sequence of numbers even in shuffled form is possible with *seq* and *shuf* commands. *tr* command is a tiny but very significant command capable of replacing characters. *sort* and *uniq* commands, when combined, can perform task of counting even for very long lists.

*Assignment:* Code Academy - Learn Command Line - Unit 2 is **DUE** this week

**Quiz 1** - Topics To Be Determined

### *October 19/21*. Working with two inputs, whether it's a list or a file

*comm* can find intersection (or other set operations) between to sets (aka lists) and *join* can merge to different files by using a common column. *paste* perfoms simple merge (side by side)

*Assignment:* Code Academy - Learn Command Line - Unit 3 is **DUE** this week

### *October 26/28*. Find the line that contains a pattern

*grep* is an essential tool to reveal lines that contain desired pattern. The pattern can be a simple text or a regular expression

Study for next week: Please study *sed* and *awk* sections from our book for next week. You need to have an idea about these commands in order to follow next week's lecture.

### *November 2/4*. sed and awk

*sed* and *awk* are very important two commands (actually awk is a simple programming language) to manipulate text and filter text, respectively. *sed* is capable performing edits within a stream of data. *awk* can be used to view rows that meet certain criteria. Also, *awk* allows user to have manipulate the output.

### *(November 9/11). Midterm*

### *November 16/18*. Loops

Terminal can actually be programmed. It's possible to use *for* or *while* loops that are common in most programming languages in bash environment as well. After learning loops, it's trivial to process thousands of files with single command.

*Assignment:* GitHub pull requests for Chapter 2 are **DUE** this week

### *November 23/25*. Databases and introduction to SQL

You'll get an idea about the meaning of databases. You'll be explained the need for normalization of complex data into separate tables. Finally, you'll be introduced to structured query language *SQL* and softwares that use SQL to query their data. *MySQL* is more common but difficult to setup thus you'll be learning *Sqlite3*.

### *November 30/December 2*. Create table, insert data into tables

Let's understand the concept of *schema* and see that we have to strictly follow the schema when inserting data into table.

**Quiz 2** - Topics To Be Determined

*Assignment:* GitHub pull requests for Chapter 3 are **DUE** this week

### *December 7/9*. Querying tables

Creating a table and insterting data into a table was cumbersome, after that it's payback time. SQL is robust in querying tables. Filtering and sorting in SQL are like a breeze. *Aggregate* functions adds even more power into queries
 
*Assignment:* Code Academy - Learn SQL - Unit 1 is **DUE** this week

### *December 14/16*. Querying multiple tables and beyond SQL (NoSQL)

Joining tables is much easier than its terminal counterpart *join* command. The *schema* was such a pain when dealing with tables. Thus, there's new trend of database technologies, loosely named NoSQL, which lack a schema. An example from graph database will blow your mind.

**Quiz 3** - Topics To Be Determined

### *December 21/23*. Gnuplot - part 1

If you had taken *MATLAB* courses, you'd be familiar with the concept of using scripts to generate graphs. *Gnuplot* is very efficient in doing so. Just by couple of lines of code, data from a large file can be converted into a graph.

*Assignment:* Code Academy - Learn SQL - Units 2 **AND** 3 are **DUE** this week

### *December 28/30*. Gnuplot - part 2

More examples regarding *Gnuplot*

*Assignment:* GitHub pull requests for Chapters 3,4 and 5 are **DUE** this week

*Final lecture*: A make up quiz will take place in order to replace lowest scoring quiz score
