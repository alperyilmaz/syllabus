# Course Materials

The lecture notes are taken from the following textbook: **LEHNINGER PRINCIPLES OF BIOCHEMISTRY** *(David L. Nelson,Michael M. Cox, 5. Edition, 2008)*. The figures in slides are taken from 6th edition, so there might be discrepancy about figure numbers.

Lecture notes are handed in copy center across our department. PDF versions of lecture slides can be downloaded from [YARBIS page](http://yarbis.yildiz.edu.tr/alyilmaz/course/viewCourse/id/7176).

Lecture notes contain mostly pics with sparse text, thus you need to listen the instructor and take notes.

# Grading

Your grade will come from the following sources:

* Midterm: 35%
* Final: 40%
* Quiz: 10%
* Assignment: 10%
* Attendance: 5%

Final exam is from the topics covered after midterm exam.

There will be 3 quizzes and highest 2 scores will be considered. If you attend all lectures or miss only one lecture then you'll get 5 points for attendance. For every 1-2 lectures missed you'll lose 1 point.

Assignment will be 2-3 page long writing about *Oxygen binding property of fetal hemoglobin*. 

# Communication

I'm trying to respond emails as quickly as possible. If you don't get a response within 1-2 days please don't hesitate to send a reminder email.

The changes pertaining to exam date, time and assignment due dates should be decided in class after discussing with everybody. Please don't ask for changes individually, otherwise notification of whole class becomes a hassle.
