# Course Materials

There's no set textbook for this course. Students are expected to follow the lecture through handouts.

Lecture notes are handed in copy center across our department. PDF versions of lecture slides can be downloaded from [YARBIS page](http://yarbis.yildiz.edu.tr/alyilmaz/course/viewCourse/id/6399).

Lecture notes contain mostly pics with sparse text, thus you need to listen the instructor and take notes.

# Grading

Your grade will come from the following sources:

* Midterm: 35%
* Final: 40%
* Quiz: 10%
* Debate: 10%
* Attendance: 5%

There will be 3 quizes and highest 2 scores will be considered. If you attend all lectures or miss only one lecture then you'll get 5 points for attendance. For every 1-2 lectures missed you'll lose 1 point.

For the debate, each student will pick a side (for or against GMO) and defend his/her position individually with **scientific articles**. Also, a short report of the findings should be handed in to instructor.

# Communication

I'm trying to respond emails as quickly as possible. If you don't get a response within 1-2 days please don't hesitate to send a reminder email.

The changes pertaining to exam date, time and assignment due dates should be decided in class after discussing with everybody. Please don't ask for changes individually, otherwise notification of whole class becomes a hassle.
