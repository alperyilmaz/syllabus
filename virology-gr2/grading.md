# Course Materials

Course textbook(s) are *Virology: Principles and Applications* by John Carter and Venetia Saunders (2007). In addition we might refer to another book, *Fundamentals of Molecular Virology* by Nicholas Acheson (2011). 

Lecture notes are handed in copy center across our department. PDF versions of lecture slides can be downloaded from [YARBIS page](http://yarbis.yildiz.edu.tr/alyilmaz/course/viewCourse/id/6378).

Lecture notes contain more pics with sparse text, thus you need to listen the instructor and take notes.

# Grading

Your grade will come from the following sources:

* Midterm: 35%
* Final: 35%
* Quiz: 15%
* Assignment: 10%
* Attendance: 5%

There will be 4 quizes and 3 highest scores will be considered. If you attend all lectures or miss only one lecture then you'll get 5 points. For every 1-2 lectures missed you'll lose 1 point.

Final exam will be from lectures discussed after Midterm exam.

Number and content of assignments will be provided later. The assignments will be related to "applications of a given virus to bioengineering problems".

# Communication

I'm trying to respond emails as quickly as possible. If you don't get a response within 1-2 days please don't hesitate to send a reminder email.

The changes pertaining to exam date, time and assignment due dates should be decided in class after discussing with everybody. Please don't ask for changes individually, otherwise notification of whole class becomes a hassle.
